# Natural Typer

Natural Typer is a specialized tool designed to help content creators, developers, and educators produce professional-looking screen recordings. It simulates natural human typing with adjustable speeds and occasional "human" mistakes that are automatically corrected, making your demos look authentic rather than robotic.

## Features

- **Realistic Typing Simulation:** The engine introduces variable delays and randomized errors to mimic human typing patterns.
- **Audio Feedback:** Includes soothing mechanical keyboard sounds with adjustable volume for an immersive experience.
- **Customizable Appearance:** Choose from popular coding fonts (Fira Code, JetBrains Mono, etc.), adjust font sizes, and switch between Dark and Light modes.
- **Layout Control:** Fine-tune page margins and alignment to fit your recording overlay perfectly.
- **Distraction-Free UI:** A clean interface that focuses purely on the content, with auto-hiding controls.

## How to Use

1. **Input Your Text:** Paste the code or script you want to be typed into the input field.
2. **Adjust Settings:** Set your desired typing speed, mistake rate, and styling preferences in the settings panel.
3. **Start Recording:** Press the Spacebar or click Start to begin the typing simulation.
